# Privacy & Terms of use

** As of 21/01/2021**

The Sensorslog project is a non commercial project mainly provided for experimentation. All the code, both frontend & backend, can be seen/retrieved/copied from the GitHub repositories linked below the home page.

We are not using your data AT ALL. We have no interest in your data. You can retrieve your data within the dashboard. It will be provided to you under a csv format.

## Your privacy

We only ask you to register in order to be able to deliver a personal api key. You will have to provide an email and a username and a password of your choice. The password will be directly encrypted when reaching the backend. You are the only responsible of the api key and its usage. You can, at any time, replace that api key from within your account page.

At any time, you can destroy you account. Every data logged and also your account will be PHYSICALLY DELETED. It will be impossible to retrieve your data afterwards. It's like you've never been there. We keep/have no logs of your usage.

## Support

We won't provide support for Sensorslog. Its usage is free and exists mainly for experimentation. However, suggestions to improve will be taken into account.

## Collaboration

No support does not mean we can't work together if the project has an interest to you. In that case, GitHub will be the main plateform of communication.
